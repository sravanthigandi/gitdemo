git rebase and git merge- both are working on thsimilar plroblem
git merge- intergrated the changes made in feature branch to main branch. here pollute the feature branch history. 
it cam make hard for developers to understand the history of the project 
git rebase- intergrated the changes made in feature branch to main brach but here the commit history is very clean 
the main advantage of this is to main the history it is easy for developers to read the history of the project.
git rebase can never use in public history
